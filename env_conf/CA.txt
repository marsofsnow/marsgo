Cloning into 'mailman-bundler'...
fatal: unable to access 'https://gitlab.com/mailman/mailman-bundler.git/': Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)


You may be missing ca-certificates package on your system (which was probably newly installed).

To fix (on Ubuntu or Debian systems):

# apt-get install ca-certificates

在ubuntu下 安装ca 一般自动安装openssl
